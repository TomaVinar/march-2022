    Bart Simpson is a fictional character in the American animated television series The Simpsons and part
    of the Simpson family. He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The
    Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed
    Bart while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series
    of shorts based on his comic strip, Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of
    characters. While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name
    is an anagram of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for two years, the Simpson
    family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. Bart has appeared in every
    Simpsons episode except "Four Great Women and a Manicure".
